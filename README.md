# Bluetooth DMM client

A Rust-based DMM client for cheap Bluetooth Low Energy digital multimeters from AliExpress.

This is my first Rust project, so the code is probably not great.

The communication protocol/API and the CLI utility should be functional. The GUI is unfinished and I currently have no plans
to finish it, I'm releasing the code in case someone wants to finish it.

The communication protocol has been implemented based on the following sources:
